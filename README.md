Description:

This project consists of developing a simplified blockchain implementation to simulate a ledger of financial transactions. A blockchain is represented as a linked list of blocks, where each block contains a transaction, a hash of the previous block, and a cryptographic hash for verification. We implemented mining to find valid nonces, validate transactions based on balances, and ensure the integrity of the chain. The project emphasize the use linked structures, cryptographic hashing, and transaction validation while building an interactive user interface for managing the blockchain.
